      <description>The goal of this guide is to show you how to add support for a new keyboard to Kaleidoscope. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t go further than that: this guide doesn&amp;rsquo;t help you maintain an hardware plugin in an external repository, nor does it document everything that makes for a good pull request for a keyboard. It goes far enough to have it working, in a quick and dirty way, anything further than that will be the topic of another guide.</description>
